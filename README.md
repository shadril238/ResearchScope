# ResearchScope

> A static-first research intelligence platform for CS papers — track what matters, who drives it, what to read first, and where the research gaps are.

## What is ResearchScope?

ResearchScope is an **open, static research intelligence dashboard** for computer science papers.
It is **not** primarily a CLI tool — it is a website that is rebuilt daily by a GitHub Actions
pipeline and published to GitHub Pages.

The pipeline fetches papers from **arXiv** and **ACL Anthology**, enriches them with scores and
tags, detects research gaps, and writes the results as static JSON + HTML to the `site/` folder.
The site then renders everything from those JSON files in the browser — no server required.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 📄 **Paper intelligence** | Papers from arXiv & ACL Anthology scored by recency, citation momentum, and relevance |
| 👩‍🔬 **Author / lab intelligence** | Track prolific authors and their recent output |
| 🗺 **Learning paths** | Curated reading paths tagged by topic and difficulty level |
| 🔍 **Research gap explorer** | Surface under-explored areas and emerging directions |
| 🖥 **Static dashboard** | Zero-backend site hosted on GitHub Pages, updated daily |

## Data Sources (MVP)

| Source | Content |
|---|---|
| **arXiv** | Preprints across CS, ML, NLP, CV, and related fields |
| **ACL Anthology** | Peer-reviewed NLP / CL papers from ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and others |

```

## Local Development

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/kishormorol/ResearchScope.git
cd ResearchScope

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the pipeline locally (writes JSON to data/)
python src/pipeline.py

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Open the site locally (serve site/ with any static server)
cd site && python -m http.server 8080
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The workflow in `.github/workflows/update.yml`:

1. Runs the Python pipeline to fetch and process papers.
2. Commits any changed JSON files in `data/`.
3. Uploads the `site/` folder as a GitHub Pages artifact and deploys it.

To enable Pages for a fork: go to **Settings → Pages** and set the source to
**GitHub Actions**.
